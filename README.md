pySmithPlot: soerenbnoergaard style
===================================

This is my modifications to [pySmithPlot for Python 3](https://github.com/agardelein/pySmithPlot). The modifications are done to fit my personal liking.

Installation
------------

- Add the `smithplot` folder to a directory containing python libraries, say `/home/user/libs`.
- Add this directory to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`. Do this, e.g., in your `~/.profile` file. This may look like the following: `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/user/libs`
